1) Create project: in cmd in type django-admin startproject project_name (mysite)
This will create mysite folder

2) Copy the folder to the desired location
3) cd to desired directory in cmd

In the folder we will have one folder(same as project_name(mysite in this case)), one data base(db.sqlite3), and manage.py file.
mysite folder has more files in it and this is our primary app. Now we want to create main folder.

4) type in cmd >python manage.py startapp main
This will create the app folder. In this folder we have .py files and two folders(mainly one is migration that we will need soon) including views.py,
models.py and many more. But we need urls.py file in this folder. We can have this by copying from mysite folder.

5) copy urls.py from mysite to main folder

6) Check if server is running by typing in cmd>python manage.py runserver
This will create tab in chrome (or whatever) and will show that server is running

7) Now we have to make changes in urls.py file from mysite first. We have to always make sure that the pathspatterns matches user input.
(For example if user do not type anything but just website home page we have to point to our main app to show webpage only.)

8) Then we have to make sure that usrls.py file from the main folder then point to views.homepage function to show homepage

9) Then we also have to create this homepage function in views files.

10) Now, we have to write our model in model.py file.

11) Whatever changes we make in model.py file we have reflect that in our data base.

12) For this first we have to install our main app (which didn't come as default, we made it using manage.py). To do this go to mysite->setting.py file.
In that file write 'main.apps.MainConfig' into the INSTALLED_APP variable.

13) Then type in cmd>python manage.py makemigrations. This will make the changes.

14) Then we have to actually make migrations. To do this type in cmd>python manage.py migrate
